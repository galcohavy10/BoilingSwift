# BoilingSwift

Boilerplate Swift code and distilled examples of core iOS concepts. Designed for **seasoned developers** who want a quick, copy-paste-ready reference or a concise review of essential Swift patterns.

## üîß Purpose

This repo is a **hands-on Swift reference**, not a beginner tutorial. Each `.swift` file contains a compact example of a key concept‚Äîclear, minimal, and directly usable in real projects. It‚Äôs meant for engineers who:

- Need fast recall of core Swift ideas
- Want lightweight snippets to drop into projects
- Prefer learning by code over theory

---

## üìÅ File Breakdown

### `ARCretainDemo.swift`
**Concept:** Memory Management & ARC  
**Focus:** Shows how retain cycles work in classes and how `weak` prevents memory leaks.  
**Includes:**  
- Example of two classes holding strong references to each other  
- `deinit` not being called unless `weak` is used  
- Practical commentary on how to avoid leaks in delegate patterns and closures

---

### `AsyncNetwork.swift`
**Concept:** Asynchronous Networking with `async/await`  
**Focus:** Modern Swift concurrency; non-blocking network requests using `URLSession`.  
**Includes:**  
- Simple API call using `async/await`  
- UI-safe update pattern  
- Basic error handling enum cases

---

### `Class-Struct.swift`
**Concept:** Reference vs Value Types  
**Focus:** Demonstrates how changes to classes vs structs behave differently when assigned.  
**Includes:**  
- Mutating a struct vs a class  
- A ‚ÄúGoogle Docs vs PDF copy‚Äù analogy, where the class is referenced and everyone's updating the same instance. 
- Why structs are safer for models, but classes are used for reference-sharing

---

### `DelegateDemo.swift`
**Concept:** Delegate & Protocol Pattern  
**Focus:** Communication between objects without tight coupling  
**Includes:**  
- Simple example of a `ViewController` passing data via a delegate  
- Comments explaining why we use `weak var delegate`  
- Realistic analogy: A boss (delegate) gives tasks to an intern (child object) without needing to know how the intern will do the work ‚Äî as long as the intern follows the defined job description (protocol).

---

### `FilterMapReduce.swift`
**Concept:** Functional Programming in Swift  
**Focus:** The power of `.filter`, `.map`, and `.reduce` to transform collections  
**Includes:**  
- Real-world example (e.g. transforming a list of users)  
- Commentary on chaining and readability  
- Swift standard library idioms

---

### `Generics.swift`
**Concept:** Type Safety & Reusability  
**Focus:** Shows how to write generic functions and types  
**Includes:**  
- A generic `<T>` function  
- Explanation of why generics matter for performance and type safety  
- Short form vs verbose form of generic declarations

---

### `Optionals.swift`
**Concept:** Safe Handling of Missing Values  
**Focus:** The core concept of Swift‚Äôs type safety‚Äîoptionals.  
**Includes:**  
- `if let`, `guard let`, and optional chaining examples  
- Commented insight into why Swift forces you to unwrap  
- Real-world mistakes prevented by optionals

---

### `Sets.swift`
**Concept:** Unique Collections  
**Focus:** Differences between `Set` and `Array`, and when to use each  
**Includes:**  
- Union, intersection, subtraction  
- Hashable requirements  
- Speed advantage in membership testing

---

### `Singleton.swift`
**Concept:** Global Shared State  
**Focus:** The `static let shared` pattern for singleton instances  
**Includes:**  
- Basic singleton setup  
- Commentary on when (and when *not*) to use singletons  
- Thread-safety notes

Big credit to [Sean Allen](https://www.youtube.com/@SeanAllen) and his educational content, especially the [Delegate & Protocol Pattern Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTAziR-tY-A). Many of these examples are based on or inspired by his demonstrations. His channel is a goldmine for leveling up as an iOS engineer.

## üëã Contributing

If you have a refined Swift snippet you often reuse, feel free to fork and add to the collection. Just keep it:
- Self-contained
- Minimal
- Focused on a single concept
